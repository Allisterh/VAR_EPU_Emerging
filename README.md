R codes and input files of Master in Economics Thesis.

Once the folder is downloaded, the R code "Execute.R" call the other codes and generate all the graphs (It takes some time...). There were a trade-off between automatization and tractability in the codes, and consequently a mixed-approach was followed: for each model there is a separate file (In "3. Analysis" folder), but all call the same auxiliary functions ("Auxiliary" file). 

The *Online Appendix* is a PDF file, named "Online_Appendix_All_IRFs". The previous version, with a longer literature review is the "Previous version - ME Thesis - Nuñez, Franco.pdf" file.

Due to changes in IMF API and database, the original automated downloading doesn´t work at full anymore, but the files are kept as a check ("0_Original_Download.R" and "0. Base Download" file); all the inputs needed are in the Inputs file.
